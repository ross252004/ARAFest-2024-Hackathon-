# ARAFest 2024 Hackathon
On August 26, 2024, I participated in a hackathon in Ames, Iowa. The hackathon's purpose was to calculate an accurate analysis of the data gathered from different UV sensors. I analyzed the latency data collected by UV sensors. I have constructed graphs to do the analysis using custom Python libraries. I have used Python throughout the duration of the hackathon since it is outstanding tool for data analysis.

Please see slides from the hackathon attached - [ARAthon presentation.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16787352/ARAthon.presentation.pptx)
