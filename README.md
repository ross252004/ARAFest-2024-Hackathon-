# ARAFest 2024 Hackathon
On August 26, 2024, I participated in a hackathon in Ames, Iowa. The hackathon's purpose was to calculate an accurate analysis of the data gathered from different UV sensors. I analyzed the latency data collected by UV sensors. I have constructed graphs to do the analysis using different libraries made for Python. I have used Python throughout the duration of the hackathon since it is outstanding at data analysis.

Please see slides attached, prepared by one of my teammates -
